# TODOs

 - [ ] Middleware support (FreeRTOS, etc.)
 - [ ] Arduino framework support (needs research to check if it is possible)
 - [ ] Add more checks, for example when updating the project (`generate` command), check for boards matching and so on...
 - [ ] GUI. For example, drop the folder into small window (with checkboxes corresponding with CLI options) and get the output. At left is a list of recent projects
 - [ ] GUI. Indicate the progress as states goes forward during the run (see `scratch.py`)
 - [ ] GUI. Tests
 - [ ] VSCode plugin
 - [x] Remove casts to string where we can use path-like objects (also related to Python version as new ones receive path-like objects arguments)
 - [ ] We look for some snippets of strings in logs and output for the testing code but we hard-code them and this is not good, probably
 - [ ] Store an initial folder content in .ini config and ignore it on clean-up process. Allow the user to modify such list. Ask the confirmation of a user by-defualt and add additional option for quiet performance
 - [x] `status` CLI subcommand, why not?..
 - [ ] exclude tests from the bundle (see `setup.py` options)
 - [ ] generate code docs (help user to understand an internal kitchen, e.g. for embedding)
 - [ ] handle the project folder renaming/movement to other location and/or describe in README
 - [ ] colored logs, maybe...
 - [ ] check logging work when embed stm32pio lib in third-party stuff
 - [ ] logging process coverage in README
 - [ ] merge subprocess pipes to one where suitable (i.e. `stdout` and `stderr`)
 - [ ] redirect subprocess pipes to `DEVNULL` where suitable to suppress output
 - [ ] maybe move `_load_config_file()` to `Config` (i.e. `config.load()`)
 - [ ] handle the case when the `.ioc` file is set in `stm32pio.ini` but not present in the file system anymore
 - [ ] `stm32pio.ini` config file validation
 - [ ] CHANGELOG markdown markup
