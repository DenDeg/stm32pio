# TODOs

## Business logic, business features
 - [ ] Middleware support (FreeRTOS, etc.)
 - [ ] Arduino framework support (needs research to check if it is possible)
 - [ ] Create VSCode plugin

## GUI version
 - [ ] Notify the user that the 'board' parameter is empty
 - [ ] Mac: sometimes auto turned off shift highlighting after action (hide-restore helps)
 - [x] in `ProjectListItem` set-up `currentAction` instead of `actionRunning`
 - [ ] Some visual flaws when the window have got resized (e.g. 'Add' button goes off-screen, 'Log' area crawls onto the status bar)
 - [x] Tray icon notifications
 - [x] When the list item is not active after the action the "current stage" line is not correct anymore. Consider updating or (better) gray out
 - [ ] Tests (research approaches and patterns)
 - [ ] Test performance with a large number of projects in the model. First test was made:
      1. Some projects occasionally change `initLoading` by itself (probably Loader unloads the content) (hence cannot click on them, busy indicator appearing)
         
         Note: Delegates are instantiated as needed and may be destroyed at any time. They are parented to ListView's contentItem, not to the view itself. State should never be stored in a delegate.
         
         Use `id()` in `setInitInfo()`. Or do not use ListView at all (replace be Repeater, for example) as it can reset our "notifications"
      2. Some projects show OK even after its deletion (only the app restart helps)
 - [ ] Test with different timings
 - [x] Reduce number of calls to 'state' (many IO operations)
 - [x] Drag and drop the new folder into the app window
 - [x] Multiple projects addition
 - [ ] Divide on multiple modules (both Python and QML)
 - [ ] Implement other methods for Qt abstract models
 - [x] Warning on 'Clean' action (maybe the window with a checkbox "Do not ask in the future" (QSettings parameter))
 - [x] On 'Clean' clean the log too
 - [x] Stop the chain of commands if someone drops -1 or an exception
 - [ ] 2 types of logging formatters for 2 verbosity levels
 - [x] Check for projects duplication
 - [x] Maybe use QML State for action buttons appearance
 - [x] Projects are not destructed until quit (something preserving the link probably...)
 - [x] Fix settings (window doesn't match real)
 - [ ] `TypeError: Cannot read property 'actionRunning' of null (deconstruction order)` (on project deletion only)
 - [ ] QML logging - pass to Python' `logging` and establish a similar format. Distinguish between `console.log()`, `console.error()` and so on
 - [x] Fix high CPU usage (most likely some thread consuming)
 - [ ] Bug in log box scrolling behavior (autoscroll sometimes turns off, should re-enable when starting any action)
 - [x] Fix loader when action running
 - [ ] Start with a folder opened if it was provided on CLI (for example, `stm32pio_gui .`)
 - [x] Mark list item when action is done and it is not a current item (i.e. notify a user)
 - [x] Highlight actions that were picked for continuous run (with some border, for example)
 - [x] Mark last error'ed action
 - [x] Action buttons widget state machine diagram
 - [x] Fix messed up performance when the list index changes!
 - [ ] Linux:
      - Tooltip for 'Clean' not showing ('Add' works OK)
      - Not a monospace font in the log area
 - [ ] Relative resource paths:
 
        ```

## Core library
 - [ ] Add more checks, for example when updating the project (`generate` command), check for boards matching and so on...
 - [x] Remove casts to string where we can use path-like objects (related to Python version as new ones receive path-like objects arguments while old ones aren't)
 - [ ] We look for some snippets of strings in logs and output for the testing code but we hard-code them and this is not good, probably (e.g. 'DEBUG')
 - [ ] Store a folder initial content in .ini config and ignore it on clean-up process. Allow the user to modify such list (i.e. list of exclusion) in the config file. Mb some integration with `.gitignore`
 - [ ] at some point check for all tools (CubeMX, ...) to be present in the system (both CLI and GUI) (global `--check` command (as `--version`), also before execution of the full cycle (no sense to start if some tool doesn't exist))
 - [ ] generate code docs (help user to understand an internal mechanics, e.g. for embedding). Can be uploaded to the GitHub Wiki
 - [ ] colored logs, maybe (brakes zero-dependency principle)
 - [ ] check logging work when embed stm32pio lib in a third-party stuff (no logging setup at all)
 - [ ] merge subprocess pipes to one where suitable (i.e. `stdout` and `stderr`)
 - [ ] redirect subprocess pipes to `DEVNULL` where suitable to suppress output (tests)
 - [ ] Two words about a synchronous nature of the lib and user's responsibility of async wrapping (if needed). Also, maybe migrate to async/await approach in the future
 - [ ] `__init__`' `parameters` dict argument schema (Python 3.8 feature).
 - [ ] See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#context-info to maybe remade current logging schema (current is, perhaps, a cause of the strange error while testing (in the logging thread), also modifies global settings (log message factory))
 - [ ] UML diagrams (core, GUI back- and front-ends, thread flows, events, etc.)
 - [ ] CI is possible (Arch's AUR has the STM32CubeMX package, also there is a direct link). Deploy Docker one in Azure Pipelines, basic at Travis CI
 - [ ] Test preserving user files and folders on regeneration and mb other operations
 - [ ] Move special formatters inside the library. It is an implementation detail actually that we use subprocesses and so on
 - [ ] Mb store the last occurred exception traceback in .ini file and show on some CLI command (so we don't necessarily need to turn on the verbose mode). And, in general, we should show the error reason right off
 - [ ] 'verbose' and 'non-verbose' tests as `subTest` (also `should_log_error_...`)
 - [ ] the lib sometimes raising, sometimes returning the code and it is not consistent. While the reasons behind such behavior are clear, would be great to always return a result code and raise the exceptions in the outer scope, if there is need to
 - [ ] check board (no sense to go further on 'new' if the board in config.ini is not correct)
 - [ ] check if `platformio.ini` config will be successfully parsed when there are interpolation and/or empty parameters
 - [x] check if `.ioc` file is a text file on project initialization. Let `_find_ioc_file()` method to use explicitly provided file (useful for GUI). Maybe let user specify it via CLI
 - [ ] mb add CLI command for starting the GUI version (for example, `stm32pio --gui`)
