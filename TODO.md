# TODOs
 - [ ] Middleware support (FreeRTOS, etc.)
 - [ ] Add more checks, for example when updating the project (`generate` command), check for boards matching and so on...
 - [ ] Function annotations
 - [ ] Do we need some sort of GUI? For example, drop the folder into small window (with checkboxes corresponding with CLI options) and get the output
 - [ ] Remade as Class (constructor `__init__(project_path)`)
 - [ ] Config file for every project instead of the `settings.py` (but we still sill be storing the default parameters there)
 - [ ] Test CLI (integration testing) (i.e. run stm32pio as subprocess)
 - [ ] Maybe move test fixtures out of the 'tests' so we can use it for multiple projects (for example while testing CLI and GUI versions)
 - [ ] Upload to PyPI
 - [ ] `__main__`
