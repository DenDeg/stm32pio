# TODOs

 - [ ] Middleware support (FreeRTOS, etc.)
 - [ ] Arduino framework support (needs research to check if it is possible)
 - [ ] Add more checks, for example when updating the project (`generate` command), check for boards matching and so on...
 - [ ] GUI. Tests (research approaches and patterns)
 - [ ] GUI. Reduce number of calls to 'state' (many IO operations)
 - [ ] GUI. Drag and drop the new folder into the app window
 - [ ] GUI. Implement some other methods for Qt abstract models
 - [ ] VSCode plugin
 - [x] Remove casts to string where we can use path-like objects (related to Python version as new ones receive path-like objects arguments)
 - [ ] We look for some snippets of strings in logs and output for the testing code but we hard-code them and this is not good, probably
 - [ ] Store an initial folder content in .ini config and ignore it on clean-up process. Allow the user to modify such list
 - [x] Ask the confirmation of a user by-defualt for `clean` and add additional option for quiet performance
 - [ ] check for all tools (CubeMX, ...) to be present in the system (both CLI and GUI)
 - [x] exclude tests from the bundle (see `setup.py` options)
 - [ ] generate code docs (help user to understand an internal mechanics, e.g. for embedding). Can be uploaded to the GitHub Wiki
 - [ ] colored logs, maybe...
 - [ ] if we require `platformio` package as a dependency we probably can rely on its dependencies too
 - [ ] check logging work when embed stm32pio lib in third-party stuff (no logging setup at all)
 - [ ] merge subprocess pipes to one where suitable (i.e. `stdout` and `stderr`)
 - [ ] redirect subprocess pipes to `DEVNULL` where suitable to suppress output
 - [ ] some `stm32pio.ini` config file validation
 - [x] CHANGELOG markdown markup
 - [ ] Two words about a synchronous nature of the lib and user's responsibility of async wrapping (if needed). Also, maybe migrate to async/await approach in the future
 - [x] `shlex` for `start_editor` command option sanitizing
 - [ ] `__init__`' `parameters` dict argument schema (Python 3.8 feature). Also, maybe move `save_on_desctruction` parameter there. Maybe separate on `project_params` and `instance_opts`
 - [ ] General algo of merging a given dict of parameters with the saved one on project initialization
 - [x] parse `platformio.ini` to check its correctness in state getter
 - [ ] CubeMX 0 return code doesn't necessarily means the correct generation (e.g. migration dialog has appeared and 'Cancel' was chosen, or CubeMX_version < ioc_file_version), probably should somehow analyze the output (logs can be parsed. i.e. 2020-03-05 12:08:40,765 \[ERROR\] MainProjectManager:806 - Program Manager : The version of the current IOC is too high.)
 - [x] Dispatch tests on several files (too many code actually)
 - [x] Do not store absolute paths in config file and make a project portable (use configparser parameters interpolation). Handle renaming
 - [ ] See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#context-info to maybe replace current scheme
 - [ ] UML diagrams (core, GUI back- and front-ends)
 - [ ] CI is possible (Arch's AUR has the STM32CubeMX package, also there is a direct link). Deploy Docker in Azure Pipelines, basic at Travis CI
 - [ ] Test preserving user files and folders on regeneration and mb other operations
 - [ ] Move special formatters inside the library. It is an implementation detail actually that we use subprocesses and so on
 - [ ] Mb clean the test project tree before running the tests
 - [x] README table of contents
 - [ ] Mb store the last occurred exception traceback in .ini file and show on some CLI command (so we don't need to turn on verbose mode)
