# TODOs
 - [ ] Middleware support (FreeRTOS, etc.)
 - [ ] Add more checks, for example when updating the project (`generate` command), check for boards matching and so on...
 - [ ] Do we need some sort of GUI? For example, drop the folder into small window (with checkboxes corresponding with CLI options) and get the output
 - [ ] remade as Class (constructor init(project_path))
 - [ ] test CLI (i.e. run stm32pio as subprocess)
 - [ ] upload to PyPI
